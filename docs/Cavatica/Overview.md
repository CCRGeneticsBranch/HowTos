This method is particularly useful when dealing with a small number of files or files of small sizes.

For handling large numbers of files and files with substantial sizes such as FASTQs, VCFs, or BAM files, it's recommended to utilize the Seven Bridges Command Line Interface (CLI).

You can find detailed instructions on how to use the CLI in the official documentation: [Seven Bridges Command Line Interface Documentation](https://docs.cavatica.org/docs/seven-bridges-command-line-interface)

Using the CLI offers more efficient and flexible options for managing and downloading files from Cavatica, particularly when dealing with large datasets.
